# Java Part

## 1. Explain JVM, JRE and JDK? 

__JVM (Java Virtual Machine)__: It is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides run-time environment in which java bytecode can be executed. It follows three notations:

* Specification: It is a document that describes the implementation of the Java virtual machine. It is provided by Sun and other companies.
* Implementation: It is a program that meets the requirements of JVM specification.
* Runtime Instance: An instance of JVM is created whenever you write a java command on the command prompt and run the class.

__JRE (Java Runtime Environment)__ : JRE refers to a runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed. It implements the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and provides all the class libraries and other support files that JVM uses at runtime. So JRE is a software package that contains what is required to run a Java program. Basically, it’s an implementation of the JVM which physically exists. 

__JDK(Java Development Kit)__ : It is the tool necessary to compile, document and package Java programs. The JDK completely includes JRE which contains tools for Java programmers. The Java Development Kit is provided free of charge. Along with JRE, it includes an interpreter/loader, a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development. In short, it contains JRE + development tools.

Refer to this below image and understand how exactly these components reside: ![java](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*MsGzRuN1Q09dOkwi.png)

## 2. Is Java a Compiled or an Interpreted programming language ?


Java implementations typically use a two-step compilation process. Java source code is compiled down to bytecode by the Java compiler. The bytecode is executed by a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Modern JVMs use a technique called Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation to compile the bytecode to native instructions understood by hardware CPU on the fly at runtime.

Some implementations of JVM may choose to interpret the bytecode instead of JIT compiling it to machine code, and running it directly. While this is still considered an "interpreter," It's quite different from interpreters that read and execute the high level source code (i.e. in this case, Java source code is not interpreted directly, the bytecode, output of Java compiler, is.)

It is technically possible to compile Java down to native code ahead-of-time and run the resulting binary. It is also possible to interpret the Java code directly.

At run time, JVM interprets the byte code and executes them. However, a full interpreter based execution potentially hurts the performance of application since pretty much everything that a compiler could have done upfront at compile time will now be done repeatedly by the interpreter and this adds to the overall execution time of the program.

To summarize, depending on the execution environment, bytecode can be:

* compiled ahead of time and executed as native code (similar to most C++ compilers)
* compiled just-in-time and executed
* interpreted
* directly executed by a supported processor (bytecode is the native instruction set of some CPUs)

## 3. Why java is not 100% Object-oriented?

Java is not 100% Object-oriented because it makes use of eight primitive datatypes such as boolean, byte, char, int, float, double, long, short which are not objects.

## 4. What are wrapper classes?

Wrapper classes converts the java primitives into the reference types (objects). Every primitive data type has a class dedicated to it. These are known as wrapper classes because they “wrap” the primitive data type into an object of that class. Refer to the below image which displays different primitive type, wrapper class and constructor argument. 

## 5. What is singleton class and how can we make a class singleton?

Singleton class is a class whose only one instance can be created at any given time, in one JVM. A class can be made singleton by making its constructor private.

```java
// Java program implementing Singleton class
// with getInstance() method
class Singleton
{
    // static variable single_instance of type Singleton
    private static Singleton single_instance = null;
 
    // variable of type String
    public String s;
 
    // private constructor restricted to this class itself
    private Singleton()
    {
        s = "Hello I am a string part of Singleton class";
    }
 
    // static method to create instance of Singleton class
    public static Singleton getInstance()
    {
        if (single_instance == null)
            single_instance = new Singleton();
 
        return single_instance;
    }
}
```
The best example of singleton usage scenario is when there is a limit of having only one connection to a database due to some driver limitations or because of any licensing issues.

## 6. What is the difference between Array list and vector?

|Array List	| Vector |
| ---------- | -------|
|Array List is not synchronized. | Vector is synchronized. |
|Array List is fast as it’s non-synchronized. | Vector is slow as it is thread safe. |
|If an element is inserted into the Array List, it increases its Array size by 50%.	|Vector defaults to doubling size of its array. |
|Array List does not define the increment size.	| Vector defines the increment size. |
|Array List can only use Iterator for traversing an Array List.	| Except Hashtable, Vector is the only other class which uses both Enumeration and Iterator. |

## 7.  What is the difference between equals() and == ?

Equals() method is defined in Object class in Java and used for checking equality of two objects defined by business logic.
“==” or equality operator in Java is a binary operator provided by Java programming language and used to compare primitives and objects. public boolean equals(Object o) is the method provided by the Object class. The default implementation uses == operator to compare two objects. For example: method can be overridden like String class. equals() method is used to compare the values of two objects.

* .equals(...) will only compare what it is written to compare, no more, no less.
* If a class does not override the equals method, then it defaults to the equals(Object o) method of the closest parent class that has overridden this method.
* If no parent classes have provided an override, then it defaults to the method from the ultimate parent class, Object, and so you're left with the Object#equals(Object o) method. Per the Object API this is the same as ==; that is, it returns true if and only if both variables refer to the same object, if their references are one and the same. Thus you will be testing for object equality and not functional equality.
* Always remember to override hashCode if you override equals so as not to "break the contract". As per the API, the result returned from the hashCode() method for two objects must be the same if their equals methods show that they are equivalent. The converse is not necessarily true.

## 8. What are the differences between Heap and Stack Memory?
The major difference between Heap and Stack memory are:

|Features	| Stack |	Heap |
|-----------| -------| ------|
|Memory	| Stack memory is used only by one thread of execution.	| Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application.|
| Access |	Stack memory can’t be accessed by other threads. |	Objects stored in the heap are globally accessible. |
| Memory Management	| Follows LIFO manner to free memory. |	Memory management is based on generation associated to each object. |
| Lifetime	| Exists until the end of execution of the thread.	| Heap memory lives from the start till the end of application execution. |
| Usage |	Stack memory only contains local primitive and reference variables to objects in heap space. |	Whenever an object is created, it’s always stored in the Heap space. |

## 9. What is Polymorphism?

If you think about the Greek roots of the term, it should become obvious.

* Poly = many: polygon = many-sided, polystyrene = many styrenes (a), polyglot = many languages, and so on.
* Morph = change or form: morphology = study of biological form, Morpheus = the Greek god of dreams able to take any form.
So polymorphism is the ability (in programming) to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types).

For example, in many languages, integers and floats are implicitly polymorphic since you can add, subtract, multiply and so on, irrespective of the fact that the types are different. They're rarely considered as objects in the usual term.

But, in that same way, a class like BigDecimal or Rational or Imaginary can also provide those operations, even though they operate on different data types.

The classic example is the Shape class and all the classes that can inherit from it (square, circle, dodecahedron, irregular polygon, splat and so on).

With polymorphism, each of these classes will have different underlying data. A point shape needs only two co-ordinates (assuming it's in a two-dimensional space of course). A circle needs a center and radius. A square or rectangle needs two co-ordinates for the top left and bottom right corners and (possibly) a rotation. An irregular polygon needs a series of lines.

By making the class responsible for its code as well as its data, you can achieve polymorphism. In this example, every class would have its own Draw() function and the client code could simply do:

shape.Draw()
to get the correct behavior for any shape.

This is in contrast to the old way of doing things in which the code was separate from the data, and you would have had functions such as drawSquare() and drawCircle().

__Another definition__

The word polymorphism is used in various contexts and describes situations in which something occurs in several different forms. In computer science, it describes the concept that objects of different types can be accessed through the same interface. Each type can provide its own, independent implementation of this interface. It is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP).

If you’re wondering if an object is polymorphic, you can perform a simple test. If the object successfully passes multiple is-a or instanceof tests, it’s polymorphic. As I’ve described in my post about inheritance, all Java classes extend the class Object. Due to this, all objects in Java are polymorphic because they pass at least two instanceof checks.

Different Types of Polymorphism
Java supports 2 types of polymorphism:

* static or compile-time
* dynamic

### Static Polymorphism
Java, like many other object-oriented programming languages, allows you to implement multiple methods within the same class that use the same name but a different set of parameters. That is called method overloading and represents a static form of polymorphism.

The parameter sets have to differ in at least one of the following three criteria:

* They need to have a different number of parameters, e.g. one method accepts 2 and another one 3 parameters.
* The types of the parameters need to be different, e.g. one method accepts a String and another one a Long.
* They need to expect the parameters in a different order, e.g. one method accepts a String and a Long and another one accepts a Long and a String. This kind of overloading is not recommended because it makes the API difficult to understand.

In most cases, each of these overloaded methods provides a different but very similar functionality.

Due to the different sets of parameters, each method has a different signature. That allows the compiler to identify which method has to be called and to bind it to the method call. This approach is called static binding or static polymorphism.

Let’s take a look at an example.

__A Simple Example for Static Polymorphism__

I use the same CoffeeMachine project as I used in the previous posts of this series. You can clone it at https://github.com/thjanssen/Stackify-OopInheritance.

The BasicCoffeeMachine class implements two methods with the name brewCoffee. The first one accepts one parameter of type CoffeeSelection. The other method accepts two parameters, a CoffeeSelection, and an int.

```
public class BasicCoffeeMachine {
    // ...
    public Coffee brewCoffee(CoffeeSelection selection) throws CoffeeException {
        switch (selection) {
        case FILTER_COFFEE:
            return brewFilterCoffee();
        default:
            throw new CoffeeException(
                "CoffeeSelection ["+selection+"] not supported!");
        }   
    }
    public List brewCoffee(CoffeeSelection selection, int number) throws CoffeeException {
        List coffees = new ArrayList(number);
        for (int i=0; i<number; i++) {
            coffees.add(brewCoffee(selection));
        }
        return coffees;
    }
    // ...
}
```

Now when you call one of these methods, the provided set of parameters identifies the method which has to be called.

In the following code snippet, I call the method only with a CoffeeSelection object. At compile time, the Java compiler binds this method call to the brewCoffee(CoffeeSelection selection) method.

```
BasicCoffeeMachine coffeeMachine = createCoffeeMachine();
coffeeMachine.brewCoffee(CoffeeSelection.FILTER_COFFEE);
```

If I change this code and call the brewCoffee method with a CoffeeSelection object and an int, the compiler binds the method call to the other brewCoffee(CoffeeSelection selection, int number) method.

```
BasicCoffeeMachine coffeeMachine = createCoffeeMachine();
List coffees = coffeeMachine.brewCoffee(CoffeeSelection.ESPRESSO, 2);
```
### Dynamic Polymorphism

This form of polymorphism doesn’t allow the compiler to determine the executed method. The JVM needs to do that at runtime.

Within an inheritance hierarchy, a subclass can override a method of its superclass. That enables the developer of the subclass to customize or completely replace the behavior of that method.

It also creates a form of polymorphism. Both methods, implemented by the super- and subclass, share the same name and parameters but provide different functionality.

Let’s take a look at another example from the CoffeeMachine project.

__Method Overriding in an Inheritance Hierarchy__
The BasicCoffeeMachine class is the superclass of the PremiumCoffeeMachine class.

![java](https://stackify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-13.png)

Both classes provide an implementation of the brewCoffee(CoffeeSelection selection) method.

```
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
public class BasicCoffeeMachine extends AbstractCoffeeMachine {
    protected Map beans;
    protected Grinder grinder;
    protected BrewingUnit brewingUnit;
    public BasicCoffeeMachine(Map beans) {
        super();
        this.beans = beans;
        this.grinder = new Grinder();
        this.brewingUnit = new BrewingUnit();
        this.configMap.put(CoffeeSelection.FILTER_COFFEE, new Configuration(30, 480));
    }
    public List brewCoffee(CoffeeSelection selection, int number) throws CoffeeException {
        List coffees = new ArrayList(number);
        for (int i=0; i<number; i++) {
            coffees.add(brewCoffee(selection));
        }
        return coffees;
    }
    public Coffee brewCoffee(CoffeeSelection selection) throws CoffeeException {
        switch (selection) {
        case FILTER_COFFEE:
            return brewFilterCoffee();
        default:
            throw new CoffeeException("CoffeeSelection ["+selection+"] not supported!");
        }
    }
    private Coffee brewFilterCoffee() {
        Configuration config = configMap.get(CoffeeSelection.FILTER_COFFEE);
        // grind the coffee beans
        GroundCoffee groundCoffee = this.grinder.grind(this.beans.get(CoffeeSelection.FILTER_COFFEE), config.getQuantityCoffee());
        // brew a filter coffee
        return this.brewingUnit.brew(CoffeeSelection.FILTER_COFFEE, groundCoffee, config.getQuantityWater());
    }
    public void addBeans(CoffeeSelection selection, CoffeeBean newBeans) throws CoffeeException {
        CoffeeBean existingBeans = this.beans.get(selection);
        if (existingBeans != null) {
            if (existingBeans.getName().equals(newBeans.getName())) {
                existingBeans.setQuantity(existingBeans.getQuantity() + newBeans.getQuantity());
            } else {
                throw new CoffeeException("Only one kind of beans supported for each CoffeeSelection.");
            }
        } else {
            this.beans.put(selection, newBeans);
        }
    }
}
```

```
import java.util.Map;
public class PremiumCoffeeMachine extends BasicCoffeeMachine {
    public PremiumCoffeeMachine(Map beans) {
        // call constructor in superclass
        super(beans);
        // add configuration to brew espresso
        this.configMap.put(CoffeeSelection.ESPRESSO, new Configuration(8, 28));
    }
    private Coffee brewEspresso() {
        Configuration config = configMap.get(CoffeeSelection.ESPRESSO);
        // grind the coffee beans
        GroundCoffee groundCoffee = this.grinder.grind(this.beans.get(CoffeeSelection.ESPRESSO), config.getQuantityCoffee());
        // brew an espresso
        return this.brewingUnit.brew(
            CoffeeSelection.ESPRESSO, groundCoffee, config.getQuantityWater());
    }
    public Coffee brewCoffee(CoffeeSelection selection) throws CoffeeException {
        if (selection == CoffeeSelection.ESPRESSO)
            return brewEspresso();
        else
            return super.brewCoffee(selection);
    }
}
```

If you read the post about the OOP concept inheritance, you already know the two implementations of the brewCoffee method. The BasicCoffeeMachine only supports the CoffeeSelection.FILTER_COFFEE. The brewCoffee method of the PremiumCoffeeMachine class adds support for CoffeeSelection.ESPRESSO. If it gets called with any other CoffeeSelection, it uses the keyword super to delegate the call to the superclass.

__Late Binding__

When you want to use such an inheritance hierarchy in your project, you need to be able to answer the following question: which method will the JVM call?

That can only be answered at runtime because it depends on the object on which the method gets called. The type of the reference, which you can see in your code, is irrelevant. You need to distinguish three general scenarios:

* Your object is of the type of the superclass and gets referenced as the superclass. So, in the example of this post, a BasicCoffeeMachine object gets referenced as a BasicCoffeeMachine.
* Your object is of the type of the subclass and gets referenced as the subclass. In the example of this post, a PremiumCoffeeMachine object gets referenced as a PremiumCoffeeMachine.
* Your object is of the type of the subclass and gets referenced as the superclass. In the CoffeeMachine example, a PremiumCoffeeMachine object gets referenced as a BasicCoffeeMachine.


__Superclass Referenced as the Superclass__

The first scenario is pretty simple. When you instantiate a BasicCoffeeMachine object and store it in a variable of type BasicCoffeeMachine, the JVM will call the brewCoffee method on the BasicCoffeeMachine class. So, you can only brew a CoffeeSelection.FILTER_COFFEE.

```
// create a Map of available coffee beans
Map beans = new HashMap();
beans.put(CoffeeSelection.FILTER_COFFEE,
new CoffeeBean("My favorite filter coffee bean", 1000));
// instantiate a new CoffeeMachine object
BasicCoffeeMachine coffeeMachine = new BasicCoffeeMachine(beans);
Coffee coffee = coffeeMachine.brewCoffee(CoffeeSelection.FILTER_COFFEE);
```

__Subclass Referenced as the Subclass__

The second scenario is similar. But this time, I instantiate a PremiumCoffeeMachine and reference it as a PremiumCoffeeMachine. In this case, the JVM calls the brewCoffee method of the PremiumCoffeeMachineclass, which adds support for CoffeeSelection.ESPRESSO.

```
// create a Map of available coffee beans
Map beans = new HashMap();
beans.put(CoffeeSelection.FILTER_COFFEE,
new CoffeeBean("My favorite filter coffee bean", 1000));
beans.put(CoffeeSelection.ESPRESSO,
new CoffeeBean("My favorite espresso bean", 1000));
// instantiate a new CoffeeMachine object
PremiumCoffeeMachine coffeeMachine = new PremiumCoffeeMachine(beans);
Coffee coffee = coffeeMachine.brewCoffee(CoffeeSelection.ESPRESSO);
```

__Subclass Referenced as the Superclass__

This is the most interesting scenario and the main reason why I explain dynamic polymorphism in such details.

When you instantiate a PremiumCoffeeMachine object and assign it to the BasicCoffeeMachine coffeeMachine variable, it still is a PremiumCoffeeMachine object. It just looks like a BasicCoffeeMachine.

The compiler doesn’t see that in the code, and you can only use the methods provided by the BasicCoffeeMachine class. But if you call the brewCoffee method on the coffeeMachine variable, the JVM knows that it is an object of type PremiumCoffeeMachine and executes the overridden method. This is called late binding.

```
// create a Map of available coffee beans
Map beans = new HashMap();
beans.put(CoffeeSelection.FILTER_COFFEE,
new CoffeeBean("My favorite filter coffee bean", 1000));
// instantiate a new CoffeeMachine object
BasicCoffeeMachine coffeeMachine = new PremiumCoffeeMachine(beans);
Coffee coffee = coffeeMachine.brewCoffee(CoffeeSelection.ESPRESSO);
```

__Summary__

Polymorphism is one of the core concepts in OOP languages. It describes the concept that different classes can be used with the same interface. Each of these classes can provide its own implementation of the interface.

Java supports two kinds of polymorphism. You can overload a method with different sets of parameters. This is called static polymorphism because the compiler statically binds the method call to a specific method.

Within an inheritance hierarchy, a subclass can override a method of its superclass. If you instantiate the subclass, the JVM will always call the overridden method, even if you cast the subclass to its superclass. That is called dynamic polymorphism.
```
class Person {
    void walk() {
        System.out.println("Can Run….");
    }
}
class Employee extends Person {
    void walk() {
        System.out.println("Running Fast…");
    }
}

Person p = new Employee(); //upcasting
p.walk(); // Running Fast…
```

## 10. What are the OOP Concepts in Java?

There are four main OOP concepts in Java. These are:

* __Abstraction.__ Abstraction means using simple things to represent complexity. We all know how to turn the TV on, but we don’t need to know how it works in order to enjoy it. In Java, abstraction means simple things like objects, classes, and variables represent more complex underlying code and data. This is important because it lets avoid repeating the same work multiple times.
* __Encapsulation.__ This is the practice of keeping fields within a class private, then providing access to them via public methods. It’s a protective barrier that keeps the data and code safe within the class itself. This way, we can re-use objects like code components or variables without allowing open access to the data system-wide.
* __Inheritance.__ This is a special feature of Object Oriented Programming in Java. It lets programmers create new classes that share some of the attributes of existing classes. This lets us build on previous work without reinventing the wheel.
* __Polymorphism.__ This Java OOP concept lets programmers use the same word to mean different things in different contexts. One form of polymorphism in Java is method overloading. That’s when different meanings are implied by the code itself. The other form is method overriding. That’s when the different meanings are implied by the values of the supplied variables. 

__How Abstraction Works__
Abstraction as an OOP concept in Java works by letting programmers create useful, reusable tools. For example, a programmer can create several different types of objects. These can be variables, functions, or data structures. Programmers can also create different classes of objects. These are ways to define the objects.

For instance, a class of variable might be an address. The class might specify that each address object shall have a name, street, city, and zip code. The objects, in this case, might be employee addresses, customer addresses, or supplier addresses.

__How Encapsulation Works__
Encapsulation lets us re-use functionality without jeopardizing security. It’s a powerful OOP concept in Java because it helps us save a lot of time. For example, we may create a piece of code that calls specific data from a database. It may be useful to reuse that code with other databases or processes. Encapsulation lets us do that while keeping our original data private. It also lets us alter our original code without breaking it for others who have adopted it in the meantime.

__How Inheritance Works__
Inheritance is another labor-saving Java OOP concept. It works by letting a new class adopt the properties of another. We call the inheriting class a subclass or a child class. The original class is often called the parent. We use the keyword extends to define a new class that inherits properties from an old class.

__How Polymorphism Works__
Polymorphism in Java works by using a reference to a parent class to affect an object in the child class. We might create a class called “horse” by extending the “animal” class. That class might also implement the “professional racing” class. The “horse” class is “polymorphic,” since it inherits attributes of both the “animal” and “professional racing” class.

Two more examples of polymorphism in Java are method overriding and method overloading.

In __method overriding__, the child class can use the OOP polymorphism concept to override a method of its parent class. That allows a programmer to use one method in different ways depending on whether it’s invoked by an object of the parent class or an object of the child class.

In __method overloading__, a single method may perform different functions depending on the context in which it’s called. That is, a single method name might work in different ways depending on what arguments are passed to it.

## 11. What is the difference between abstract classes and interfaces?

|Abstract Class	|Interfaces|
|---------------|----------|
|An abstract class can provide complete, default code and/or just the details that have to be overridden.| An interface cannot provide any code at all,just the signature.|
|In case of abstract class, a class may extend only one abstract class.	| A Class may implement several interfaces. |
| An abstract class can have non-abstract methods.	| All methods of an Interface are abstract. |
| An abstract class can have instance variables. | An Interface cannot have instance variables |
| An abstract class can have any visibility: public, private, protected. |	An Interface visibility must be public (or) none.|
|If we add a new method to an abstract class then we have the option of providing default implementation and therefore all the existing code might work properly |	If we add a new method to an Interface then we have to track down all the implementations of the interface and define implementation for the new method (this is before Java 8) |
|An abstract class can contain constructors	| An Interface cannot contain constructors |
| Abstract classes are fast	| Interfaces are slow as it requires extra indirection to find corresponding method in the actual class |

## 12. What is method overloading and method overriding?

__Method Overloading :__
* In Method Overloading, Methods of the same class shares the same name but each method must have different number of parameters or parameters having different types and order.
* Method Overloading is to “add” or “extend” more to method’s behavior.
* It is a compile time polymorphism.
* The methods must have different signature.
* It may or may not need inheritance in Method Overloading.

Let’s take a look at the example below to understand it better.

```java
class Adder {
Static int add(int a, int b)
{
return a+b;
}
Static double add( double a, double b)
{
return a+b;
}
public static void main(String args[])
{
System.out.println(Adder.add(11,11));
System.out.println(Adder.add(12.3,12.6));
}}
```

__Method Overriding :__
* In Method Overriding, sub class have the same method with same name and exactly the same number and type of parameters and same return type as a super class.
* Method Overriding is to “Change” existing behavior of method.
* It is a run time polymorphism.
* The methods must have same signature.
* It always requires inheritance in Method Overriding.

Let’s take a look at the example below to understand it better.

```java
class Car {
void run(){
System.out.println(“car is running”); 
}
Class Audi extends Car{
void run()
{
System.out.prinltn(“Audi is running safely with 100km”);
}
public static void main( String args[])
{
Car b=new Audi();
b.run();
}
}
```
## 13. Can you override a private or static method in Java?

You cannot override a private or static method in Java. If you create a similar method with same return type and same method arguments in child class then it will hide the super class method; this is known as method hiding. Similarly, you cannot override a private method in sub class because it’s not accessible there. What you can do is create another private method with the same name in the child class. Let’s take a look at the example below to understand it better.

## 14. What is multiple inheritance? Is it supported by Java?

If a child class inherits the property from multiple classes is known as multiple inheritance. Java does not allow to extend multiple classes.

The problem with multiple inheritance is that if multiple parent classes have a same method name, then at runtime it becomes difficult for the compiler to decide which method to execute from the child class.

Therefore, Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance. The problem is commonly referred as Diamond Problem.

![java](https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MultipleInheritance-Java-240x300.png)

## 15. What is association?

Association is a relationship where all object have their own lifecycle and there is no owner. Let’s take an example of Teacher and Student. Multiple students can associate with a single teacher and a single student can associate with multiple teachers but there is no ownership between the objects and both have their own lifecycle. These relationship can be one to one, One to many, many to one and many to many.

## 16. Is Java platform independent?

Yes. Java is a platform independent language. We can write java code on one platform and run it on another platform. For e.g. we can write and compile the code on windows and can run it on Linux or any other supported platform. This is one of the main features of java.

## 17. What are the various access specifiers for Java classes?

The types of access specifiers for classes are:

* Public: Class,Method,Field is accessible from anywhere.
* Protected: Method,Field can be accessed from the same class to which they belong or from the sub-classes,and from the class of same package,but not from outside.
* Default: Method,Field,class can be accessed only from the same package and not from outside of it’s native package.
* Private: Method,Field can be accessed from the same class to which they belong.

## 18. What all memory areas are allocated by JVM?

Heap, Stack, Program Counter Register and Native Method Stack.

## 19. What’s the purpose of Static methods and static variables?

When there is a requirement to share a method or a variable between multiple objects of a class instead of creating separate copies for each object, we use static keyword to make a method or variable shared for all objects. A static method or variable is shared across all object instances of that class.

## 20. What is class?

Class is nothing but a template that describes the data and behavior associated with instances of that class. Another definition is that a class represents a blueprint.

## 21. What is data encapsulation and what’s its significance?

Encapsulation is a concept in Object Oriented Programming for combining properties and methods in a single unit.

Encapsulation helps programmers to follow a modular approach for software development as each object has its own set of methods and variables and serves its functions independent of other objects. Encapsulation also serves data hiding purpose.

## 22. Primitive data types in Java and their size

* byte — 8 bit (are esp. useful when working with a stream of data from a network or a file).
* short — 16 bit
* char — 16 bit Unicode
* int — 32 bit (whole number)
* float — 32 bit (real number)
* long — 64 bit (Single precision)
* double — 64 bit (double precision)
* boolean - virtual machine dependent.

## 23. What is Unicode?

Java uses Unicode to represent the characters. Unicode defines a fully international character set that can represent all of the characters found in human languages.

## 24. What are Literals?

A literal is a value that may be assigned to a primitive or string variable or passed as an argument to a method.

## 25. What is Type casting in Java?

To create a conversion between two incompatible types, we must use a cast. There are two types of casting in java: automatic casting (done automatically) and explicit casting (done by programmer).

Java object typecasting one object reference can be type cast into another object reference. The cast can be to its own class type or to one of its subclass or superclass types or interfaces. There are compile-time rules and runtime rules for casting in java.

Typecast Objects with a dynamically loaded Class ? – The casting of object references depends on the relationship of the classes involved in the same hierarchy. Any object reference can be assigned to a reference variable of the type Object, because the Object class is a superclass of every Java class.
There can be 2 casting java scenarios

* Upcasting
* Downcasting

When we cast a reference along the class hierarchy in a direction from the root class towards the children or subclasses, it is a downcast. When we cast a reference along the class hierarchy in a direction from the sub classes towards the root, it is an upcast. We need not use a cast operator in this case.

The compile-time rules are there to catch attempted casts in cases that are simply not possible. This happens when we try to attempt casts on objects that are totally unrelated (that is not subclass super class relationship or a class-interface relationship) At runtime a ClassCastException is thrown if the object being cast is not compatible with the new type it is being cast to.

Below is an example showing when a ClassCastException can occur during object casting

```java
//X is a supper class of Y and Z which are sibblings.

public class X {}
public class Y extends X {}
public class Z extends X {}
public class RunTimeCastDemo {

	public static void main(String args[]) {
		X x = new X();
		Y y = new Y();
		Z z = new Z();
		X xy = new Y(); // compiles ok (up the hierarchy)
		X xz = new Z(); // compiles ok (up the hierarchy)
		//		Y yz = new Z();   incompatible type (siblings)
		//		Y y1 = new X();   X is not a Y
		//		Z z1 = new X();   X is not a Z
		X x1 = y; // compiles ok (y is subclass of X)
		X x2 = z; // compiles ok (z is subclass of X)
		Y y1 = (Y) x; // compiles ok but produces runtime error
		Z z1 = (Z) x; // compiles ok but produces runtime error
		Y y2 = (Y) x1; // compiles and runs ok (x1 is type Y)
		Z z2 = (Z) x2; // compiles and runs ok (x2 is type Z)
		//		Y y3 = (Y) z;     inconvertible types (siblings)
		//		Z z3 = (Z) y;     inconvertible types (siblings)
		Object o = z;
		Object o1 = (Y) o; // compiles ok but produces runtime error
	}
}
```

__CASTING OBJECT REFERENCES: IMPLICIT CASTING USING A COMPILER__

In general an implicit cast is done when an Object reference is assigned (cast) to:

* A reference variable whose type is the same as the class from which the object was instantiated.
An Object as Object is a super class of every Class.
* A reference variable whose type is a super class of the class from which the object was instantiated.
* A reference variable whose type is an interface that is implemented by the class from which the object was instantiated.
* A reference variable whose type is an interface that is implemented by a super class of the class from which the object was instantiated.

Consider an interface Vehicle, a super class Car and its subclass Ford. The following example shows the automatic conversion of object references handled by the compiler

```java
interface Vehicle {}
class Car implements Vehicle {}
class Ford extends Car {}
```

Let c be a variable of type Car class and f be of class Ford and v be an vehicle interface reference. We can assign the Ford reference to the Car variable:
I.e. we can do the following

Example 1
`c = f; //Ok Compiles fine`

Where c = new Car();
And, f = new Ford();
The compiler automatically handles the conversion (assignment) since the types are compatible (sub class – super class relationship), i.e., the type Car can hold the type Ford since a Ford is a Car.

Example 2
`v = c; //Ok Compiles fine`
`c = v; // illegal conversion from interface type to class type results in compilation error`

Where c = new Car();
And v is a Vehicle interface reference (Vehicle v)

The compiler automatically handles the conversion (assignment) since the types are compatible (class – interface relationship), i.e., the type Car can be cast to Vehicle interface type since Car implements Vehicle Interface. (Car is a Vehicle).

CASTING OBJECT REFERENCES: EXPLICIT CASTING 

Sometimes we do an explicit cast in java when implicit casts don’t work or are not helpful for a particular scenario. The explicit cast is nothing but the name of the new “type” inside a pair of matched parentheses. As before, we consider the same Car and Ford Class.

```java 
class Car {
  void carMethod(){}
}
class Ford extends Car {
 void fordMethod () {}
}
```

We also have a breakingSystem() function which takes Car reference (Superclass reference) as an input parameter.
The method will invoke carMethod() regardless of the type of object (Car or Ford Reference) and if it is a Ford object, it will also invoke fordMethod(). We use the instanceof operator to determine the type of object at run time.

```java
public void breakingSystem (Car obj) {
    obj.carMethod();
   if (obj instanceof Ford)((Ford)obj).fordMethod ();
}
```

To invoke the fordMethod(), the operation (Ford)obj tells the compiler to treat the Car object referenced by obj as if it is a Ford object. Without the cast, the compiler will give an error message indicating that fordMethod() cannot be found in the Car definition.

The following program shown illustrates the use of the cast operator with references.

Honda and Ford are Siblings in the class Hierarchy. Both these classes are subclasses of Class Car. Both Car and HeavyVehicle Class extend Object Class. Any class that does not explicitly extend some other class will automatically extends the Object by default. This code instantiates an object of the class Ford and assigns the object’s reference to a reference variable of type Car. This assignment is allowed as Car is a superclass of Ford. In order to use a reference of a class type to invoke a method, the method must be defined at or above that class in the class hierarchy. Hence an object of Class Car cannot invoke a method present in Class Ford, since the method fordMethod is not present in Class Car or any of its superclasses. Hence this problem can be colved by a simple downcast by casting the Car object reference to the Ford Class Object reference as done in the program. Also an attempt to cast an object reference to its Sibling Object reference produces a ClassCastException at runtime, although compilation happens without any error.

```java
class Car extends Object {

	void carMethod() {
	}
}

class HeavyVehicle extends Object {
}

class Ford extends Car {

	void fordMethod() {
		System.out.println("I am fordMethod defined in Class Ford");
	}
}

class Honda extends Car {

	void fordMethod() {
		System.out.println("I am fordMethod defined in Class Ford");
	}
}

public class ObjectCastingEx {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Car obj = new Ford();
		//    Following will result in compilation error
		//    obj.fordMethod();	//As the method fordMethod is undefined for the Car Type
		//  Following will result in compilation error
		// ((HeavyVehicle)obj).fordMethod();
					//fordMethod is undefined in the HeavyVehicle Type
		//  Following will result in compilation error
		((Ford) obj).fordMethod();
		//Following will compile and run
		//	Honda hondaObj = (Ford)obj;	Cannot convert as they are sibblings
	}
}
```

## 26. Why should I have super type reference & sub class object?

Just now I've got an email from one of my student with the following question: "Why should we create `Animal obj = new Dog();` instead of `Dog obj = new Dog();`" Of course the example given here is made by myself but the question in detail is why all use super interface or super class reference instead of using the same class reference. You got the question right? This article answers the question.

The answer is: "It is a best practice being followed by our ancestors. Stop asking questions and code that way :-)" 

Ok, more seriously, consider the following example:

There is a SuperFancyClass created by developer A for some super fancy purposes. Note that all the references are HashMap.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class SuperFancyClass {
    
    private HashMap<String, Object> mapOne;
    private HashMap<Integer, Object> mapTwo;

    public SuperFancyClass() {
        this.mapOne = new HashMap<>();
        this.mapTwo = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public HashMap<String, Object> doStuff1() {
        // Do something
        return this.mapOne;
    }

    public HashMap<String, Object> doStuff2() {
        // Do something
        return this.mapOne;
    }

    public HashMap<Integer, Object> doStuff3() {
        // Do something
        return this.mapTwo;
    }

    // Some other highly complex code here
}
```

That class is being used by developer B as given below.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class SensitiveAgent {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        SuperFancyClass superFancy = new SuperFancyClass();
        HashMap<String, Object> map1 = superFancy.doStuff1();
        HashMap<String, Object> map2 = superFancy.doStuff2();
        HashMap<Integer, Object> map3 = superFancy.doStuff3();
    }
    // Some other highly complex code here
}
```

Assuming both classes are highly complex but both developers A and B are happy with what they have, there is nothing else to worry.

As time progress, now developer A wants to make his Maps to maintain the insertion order. The Java API says, `HashMap` does not respect the insertion order so if you need insertion order, you need to switch to `LinkedHashMap`.

So now developer A wants to find and replace all of his/her HashMaps by LinkedHashMap. But this will not be such a short happy ending story in a highly complex code base where there can be several other local HashMaps which cannot be replaced by LinkedHashMap. So in reality, developer A has to go and change everywhere it requires to LinkedHashMap as provided below.

```java
import java.util.LinkedHashMap;

public class SuperFancyClass {
    
    private LinkedHashMap<String, Object> mapOne;
    private LinkedHashMap<Integer, Object> mapTwo;

    public SuperFancyClass() {
        this.mapOne = new LinkedHashMap<>();
        this.mapTwo = new LinkedHashMap<>();
    }

    public LinkedHashMap<String, Object> doStuff1() {
        // Do something
        return this.mapOne;
    }

    public LinkedHashMap<String, Object> doStuff2() {
        // Do something
        return this.mapOne;
    }

    public LinkedHashMap<Integer, Object> doStuff3() {
        // Do something
        return this.mapTwo;
    }

    // Some other highly complex code here
}
```

But now the code of developer B collapses because of the changes done in SuperFancyClass. Then developer B has to go and change the references from HashMap to LinkedHashMap as shown below.

```java
import java.util.LinkedHashMap;

public class SensitiveAgent {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        SuperFancyClass superFancy = new SuperFancyClass();
        LinkedHashMap<String, Object> map1 = superFancy.doStuff1();
        LinkedHashMap<String, Object> map2 = superFancy.doStuff2();
        LinkedHashMap<Integer, Object> map3 = superFancy.doStuff3();
    }

    // Some other highly complex code here
}
```

Rule of debugging:
Now, this is the time to introduce an important rule of debugging: 

__Fixing a bug is equivalent to making several other bugs.__

In other words, if you modify an existing code, the number of changes you have made will be proportional to the number of newly expected bugs because we are all human and we do mistakes. Without our intention, we might delete a local variable that hides an instance variable. Or else we might modify that single line which causes to bring the entire world to end. So always keep your changes as less as possible.
Coming back to the previous scenario, developer A modifies the SuperFancyClass in 7 places and developer B has to modify the SensitiveAgent in 3 places. Even in a code-base which contains two dummy classes, there are 10 places altogether to modify. Just imagine a project with hundreds/thousands of classes and millions of lines. Yep they do exists and it will be a catastrophic.

Time to travel back...
Suppose if the developer A designed his/her class as given below using super interface references (However the objects must be created using subclass. See the constructor):

```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.HashMap;

public class SuperFancyClass {
    
    private Map<String, Object> mapOne;
    private Map<Integer, Object> mapTwo;

    public SuperFancyClass() {
        this.mapOne = new HashMap<>();
        this.mapTwo = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public Map<String, Object> doStuff1() {
        // Do something
        return this.mapOne;
    }

    public Map<String, Object> doStuff2() {
        // Do something
        return this.mapOne;
    }

    public Map<Integer, Object> doStuff3() {
        // Do something
        return this.mapTwo;
    }

    // Some other highly complex code here
}
```

The developer B would developed his/her code like this because the return types of those methods are Map; the super interface:

```java
import java.util.Map;

public class SensitiveAgent {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        SuperFancyClass superFancy = new SuperFancyClass();
        Map<String, Object> map1 = superFancy.doStuff1();
        Map<String, Object> map2 = superFancy.doStuff2();
        Map<Integer, Object> map3 = superFancy.doStuff3();
    }

    // Some other highly complex code here
}
```

Now if the same situation comes where the developer A wants to preserve insertion order in his/her maps, only lines he/she has to change are just those two lines inside the constructor as shown below:

```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.LinkedHashMap;

public class SuperFancyClass {
    
    private Map<String, Object> mapOne;
    private Map<Integer, Object> mapTwo;

    public SuperFancyClass() {
        this.mapOne = new LinkedHashMap<>();
        this.mapTwo = new LinkedHashMap<>();
    }

    public Map<String, Object> doStuff1() {
        // Do something
        return this.mapOne;
    }

    public Map<String, Object> doStuff2() {
        // Do something
        return this.mapOne;
    }

    public Map<Integer, Object> doStuff3() {
        // Do something
        return this.mapTwo;
    }

    // Some other highly complex code here
}
```

Developer B does not need to change anything because there is nothing changed int the API level (return types are not changed by developer A). So now the same behavior is achieved with less number of modifications (This time only 2). This is what we call extensible, modifiable, (all those blah-blah-blah-able) code.

Then why not Object instead of Map?

Now you may have a question: Should we always use the super most interface/class as the reference? Not always. It depends on the requirements. Climbing towards super types means, we are limiting the features because 99% of the time, sub classes have more features than super types. For example, compare java.lang.Number with its sub classes or compare java.util.Collection with its sub interfaces/classes. So use the super type reference which has all the functionalities you are expected to have.

Does the rule applied to local variables?
Then what is the advantage of using super reference in local variables which have no impact on others? I guess this is because we developers are used to that and there is nothing wrong in following the same practice in local variables. For example, consider this case:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Java");
        list.add("Python");
        list.add("C++");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}
```

In this code there is no advantage of using super interface reference but I do write this way because I am used to it. If there is no disadvantages, why do you bother about it? Keep calm and code your references in super type :-)

## 27. What is the difference between double and float variables in Java?

In Java, float takes 4 bytes in memory while Double takes 8 bytes in memory. Float is single precision floating point decimal number while Double is double precision decimal number.

## 28. Can we override a static method?
No, we cannot override a static method

## 29. Does Java support operator overloading?
Operator overloading is not supported in Java.

## 30. Can we overload a method by just changing the return type and without changing the signature of method?
No, We cannot do this.

## 31. Is it possible to overload main() method of a class?
Yes, we can overload main() method as well.

## 32. What is the difference between an Inner Class and a Sub-Class?

An Inner class is a class which is nested within another class. An Inner class has access rights for the class which is nesting it and it can access all variables and methods defined in the outer class.

## 33. What is static and dynamic binding?

Here are a few important differences between static and dynamic binding:

* Static binding in Java occurs during compile time while dynamic binding occurs during runtime.
* private, final and static methods and variables use static binding and are bonded by compiler while virtual methods are bonded during runtime based upon runtime object.
* Static binding uses Type (class in Java) information for binding while dynamic binding uses object to resolve binding.
* Overloaded methods are bonded using static binding while overridden methods are bonded using dynamic binding at runtime.

Here is an example which will help you to understand both static and dynamic binding in Java.

__Static Binding Example in Java__

```java
public class StaticBindingTest {  
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Collection c = new HashSet();
        StaticBindingTest et = new StaticBindingTest();
        et.sort(c);
    }
    //overloaded method takes Collection argument
    public Collection sort(Collection c) {
        System.out.println("Inside Collection sort method");
        return c;
    }
    //another overloaded method which takes HashSet argument which is sub class
    public Collection sort(HashSet hs) {
        System.out.println("Inside HashSet sort method");
        return hs;
    }
}
```
_Output: Inside Collection sort method_

__Example of Dynamic Binding in Java__

```java
public class DynamicBindingTest {   
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Vehicle vehicle = new Car(); //here Type is vehicle but object will be Car
        vehicle.start(); //Car's start called because start() is overridden method
    }
}

class Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Inside start method of Vehicle");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Inside start method of Car");
    }
}
```
_Output: Inside start method of Car_

A sub-class is a class which inherits from another class called super class. Sub-class can access all public and protected methods and fields of its super class.

## 34. What is the difference between abstract class and interface?

The primary difference between an abstract class and interface is that an interface can only possess declaration of public static methods with no concrete implementation while an abstract class can have members with any access specifiers (public, private etc) with or without concrete implementation. Interfaces are slower in performance as compared to abstract classes as extra indirections are required for interfaces.

Another key difference in the use of abstract classes and interfaces is that a class which implements an interface must implement all the methods of the interface while a class which inherits from an abstract class doesn’t require implementation of all the methods of its super class.

A class can implement multiple interfaces but it can extend only one abstract class.

Also:
* Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods. An interface can only have abstract methods.
* An abstract class can have static methods but an interface cannot have static methods.
* Abstract class can have constructors but an interface cannot have constructors.

## 35. Can Java interfaces have fields?
 
Yes. 
All fields in interface are public static final, i.e. they are constants.

It is generally recommended to avoid such interfaces, but sometimes you can find an interface that has no methods and is used only to contain list of constant values.

## 36. Which access modifiers can be applied to the inner classes?
public ,private , abstract, final, protected.

## 37. Can main() method in Java can return any data?

In Java, main() method can’t return any data and hence, it’s always declared with a void return type.

## 38. Can we declare a class as Abstract without having any abstract method?

Yes we can create an abstract class by using abstract keyword before class name even if it doesn’t have any abstract method. However, if a class has even one abstract method, it must be declared as abstract otherwise it will give an error.

## 39. Is Java “pass-by-reference” or “pass-by-value”?

Java is always pass-by-value. Unfortunately, they decided to call the location of an object a "reference". When we pass the value of an object, we are passing the reference to it. This is confusing to beginners.

It goes like this:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Dog aDog = new Dog("Max");
    // we pass the object to foo
    foo(aDog);
    // aDog variable is still pointing to the "Max" dog when foo(...) returns
    aDog.getName().equals("Max"); // true, java passes by value
    aDog.getName().equals("Fifi"); // false 
}

public static void foo(Dog d) {
    d.getName().equals("Max"); // true
    // change d inside of foo() to point to a new Dog instance "Fifi"
    d = new Dog("Fifi");
    d.getName().equals("Fifi"); // true
}
```

In the example above aDog.getName() will still return "Max". The value aDog within main is not changed in the function foo with the Dog "Fifi" as the object reference is passed by value. If it were passed by reference, then the aDog.getName() in main would return "Fifi" after the call to foo.

Likewise:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Dog aDog = new Dog("Max");
    foo(aDog);
    // when foo(...) returns, the name of the dog has been changed to "Fifi"
    aDog.getName().equals("Fifi"); // true
}

public static void foo(Dog d) {
    d.getName().equals("Max"); // true
    // this changes the name of d to be "Fifi"
    d.setName("Fifi");
}
```

In the above example, Fifi is the dog's name after call to foo(aDog) because the object's name was set inside of foo(...). Any operations that foo performs on d are such that, for all practical purposes, they are performed on aDog itself (except when d is changed to point to a different Dog instance like d = new Dog("Boxer")).

## 40. What is static block?
A static block gets executed at the time of class loading. They are used for initializing static variables.

## 41. Use of final keyword in Java

* Final methods — These methods cannot be overridden by any other method.
* Final variable — Constants, the value of these variable can’t be changed, its fixed.
* Final class — Such classes cannot be inherited by other classes. These type of classes will be used when application required security or someone don’t want that particular class.

## 42. How an object is serialized in java?

In Java, to convert an object into byte stream by serialization, an interface with the name Serializable is implemented by the class. All objects of a class implementing serializable interface get serialized and their state is saved in byte stream.

When we should use serialization?

Serialization is used when data needs to be transmitted over the network. Using serialization, object’s state is saved and converted into byte stream .The byte stream is transferred over the network and the object is re-created at destination.

## 43. What are the types of exceptions?

There are two types of exceptions: checked and unchecked exceptions.
* Checked exceptions: These exceptions must be handled by programmer otherwise the program would throw a compilation error.
* Unchecked exceptions: It is up to the programmer to write the code in such a way to avoid unchecked exceptions. You would not get a compilation error if you do not handle these exceptions. These exceptions occur at runtime.

## 44. In the below example, how many String Objects are created?

```java
String s1=”I am Java Expert”;
String s2=”I am C Expert”;
String s3=”I am Java Expert”;
```

In the above example, two objects of Java.Lang.String class are created. s1 and s3 are references to same object.

Thanks to the immutability of Strings in Java, the JVM can optimize the amount of memory allocated for them by storing only one copy of each literal String in the pool. This process is called interning.

When we create a String variable and assign a value to it, the JVM searches the pool for a String of equal value.
If found, the Java compiler will simply return a reference to its memory address, without allocating additional memory.
If not found, it’ll be added to the pool (interned) and its reference will be returned.

Let’s write a small test to verify this:

```java
String constantString1 = "Baeldung";
String constantString2 = "Baeldung";
         
assertThat(constantString1).isSameAs(constantString2);
```

## 45. What is multi-threading?

Multithreading is a programming concept to run multiple tasks in a concurrent manner within a single program. Threads share same process stack and running in parallel. It helps in performance improvement of any program.

## 46. Describe and compare fail-fast and fail-safe iterators. Give examples.

The main distinction between fail-fast and fail-safe iterators is whether or not the collection can be modified while it is being iterated. Fail-safe iterators allow this; fail-fast iterators do not.

__Fail-fast__ iterators operate directly on the collection itself. During iteration, fail-fast iterators fail as soon as they realize that the collection has been modified (i.e., upon realizing that a member has been added, modified, or removed) and will throw a ConcurrentModificationException. Some examples include ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap (most JDK1.4 collections are implemented to be fail-fast).

__Fail-safe__ iterates operate on a cloned copy of the collection and therefore do not throw an exception if the collection is modified during iteration. Examples would include iterators returned by ConcurrentHashMap or CopyOnWriteArrayList.

## 47. ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector are all implementations of the List interface. Which of them is most efficient for adding and removing elements from the list? Explain your answer, including any other alternatives you may be aware of.

Of the three, LinkedList is generally going to give you the best performance. Here’s why:

* ArrayList and Vector each use an array to store the elements of the list. As a result, when an element is inserted into (or removed from) the middle of the list, the elements that follow must all be shifted accordingly. Vector is synchronized, so if a thread-safe implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use ArrayList rather than Vector.

* LinkedList, on the other hand, is implemented using a doubly linked list. As a result, an inserting or removing an element only requires updating the links that immediately precede and follow the element being inserted or removed.

However, it is worth noting that if performance is that critical, it’s better to just use an array and manage it yourself, or use one of the high performance 3rd party packages such as Trove or HPPC.

## 48. Why would it be more secure to store sensitive data (such as a password, social security number, etc.) in a character array rather than in a String?

In Java, Strings are immutable and are stored in the String pool. What this means is that, once a String is created, it stays in the pool in memory until being garbage collected. Therefore, even after you’re done processing the string value (e.g., the password), it remains available in memory for an indeterminate period of time thereafter (again, until being garbage collected) which you have no real control over. Therefore, anyone having access to a memory dump can potentially extract the sensitive data and exploit it.

In contrast, if you use a mutable object like a character array, for example, to store the value, you can set it to blank once you are done with it with confidence that it will no longer be retained in memory.

## 49. What is the ThreadLocal class? How and why would you use it?

A single ThreadLocal instance can store different values for each thread independently. Each thread that accesses the get() or set() method of a ThreadLocal instance is accessing its own, independently initialized copy of the variable. ThreadLocal instances are typically private static fields in classes that wish to associate state with a thread (e.g., a user ID or transaction ID). The example below, from the ThreadLocal Javadoc, generates unique identifiers local to each thread. A thread’s id is assigned the first time it invokes ThreadId.get() and remains unchanged on subsequent calls.

```java
public class ThreadId {
    // Next thread ID to be assigned
    private static final AtomicInteger nextId = new AtomicInteger(0);

    // Thread local variable containing each thread's ID
    private static final ThreadLocal<Integer> threadId =
        new ThreadLocal<Integer>() {
            @Override protected Integer initialValue() {
                return nextId.getAndIncrement();
        }
    };

    // Returns the current thread's unique ID, assigning it if necessary
    public static int get() {
        return threadId.get();
    }
}
```

Each thread holds an implicit reference to its copy of a thread-local variable as long as the thread is alive and the ThreadLocal instance is accessible; after a thread goes away, all of its copies of thread-local instances are subject to garbage collection (unless other references to these copies exist).

## 50. What is the volatile keyword? How and why would you use it?

In Java, each thread has its own stack, including its own copy of variables it can access. When the thread is created, it copies the value of all accessible variables into its own stack. The volatile keyword basically says to the JVM “Warning, this variable may be modified in another Thread”.

In all versions of Java, the volatile keyword guarantees global ordering on reads and writes to a variable. This implies that every thread accessing a volatile field will read the variable’s current value instead of (potentially) using a cached value.

In Java 5 or later, volatile reads and writes establish a happens-before relationship, much like acquiring and releasing a mutex.

Using volatile may be faster than a lock, but it will not work in some situations. The range of situations in which volatile is effective was expanded in Java 5; in particular, double-checked locking now works correctly.

The volatile keyword is also useful for 64-bit types like long and double since they are written in two operations. Without the volatile keyword you risk stale or invalid values.

One common example for using volatile is for a flag to terminate a thread. If you’ve started a thread, and you want to be able to safely interrupt it from a different thread, you can have the thread periodically check a flag (i.e., to stop it, set the flag to true). By making the flag volatile, you can ensure that the thread that is checking its value will see that it has been set to true without even having to use a synchronized block. For example:

```java
public class Foo extends Thread {
    private volatile boolean close = false;
    public void run() {
        while(!close) {
            // do work
        }
    }
    public void close() {
        close = true;
        // interrupt here if needed
    }
}
```


# JavaScript Part

## 1. What is a potential pitfall with using `typeof bar === "object"` to determine if bar is an object? How can this pitfall be avoided?

Although `typeof bar === "object"` is a reliable way of checking if bar is an object, the surprising gotcha in JavaScript is that null is also considered an object!

```javascript
var bar = null;
console.log(typeof bar === "object");  // logs true!
```


## 2. What will the code below output to the console and why?

```javascript
(function(){
  var a = b = 3;
})();

console.log("a defined? " + (typeof a !== 'undefined'));
console.log("b defined? " + (typeof b !== 'undefined'));
```

Since both `a` and `b` are defined within the enclosing scope of the function, and since the line they are on begins with the var keyword, most JavaScript developers would expect typeof a and typeof b to both be undefined in the above example.

However, that is not the case. The issue here is that most developers incorrectly understand the statement `var a = b = 3;` to be shorthand for:
```javascript
var b = 3;
var a = b;
```
But in fact, var a = b = 3; is actually shorthand for:
```javascript
b = 3;
var a = b;
```
As a result (if you are not using strict mode), the output of the code snippet would be:
```javascript
a defined? false
b defined? true
```
But how can b be defined outside of the scope of the enclosing function? Well, since the statement `var a = b = 3;` is shorthand for the statements `b = 3`; and `var a = b;`, `b` ends up being a global variable (since it is not preceded by the `var` keyword) and is therefore still in scope even outside of the enclosing function.

Note that, in strict mode (i.e., with `use strict`), the statement `var a = b = 3;` will generate a runtime error of ReferenceError: `b` is not defined, thereby avoiding any headfakes/bugs that might othewise result. (Yet another prime example of why you should use use strict as a matter of course in your code!)

## 3. What will the code below output to the console and why?
```javascript
var myObject = {
    foo: "bar",
    func: function() {
        var self = this;
        console.log("outer func:  this.foo = " + this.foo);
        console.log("outer func:  self.foo = " + self.foo);
        (function() {
            console.log("inner func:  this.foo = " + this.foo);
            console.log("inner func:  self.foo = " + self.foo);
        }());
    }
};
myObject.func();
```

_Output_
```javascript
outer func:  this.foo = bar
outer func:  self.foo = bar
inner func:  this.foo = undefined
inner func:  self.foo = bar
```

In the outer function, both `this` and `self` refer to myObject and therefore both can properly reference and access foo.

In the inner function, though, `this` no longer refers to myObject. As a result, `this.foo` is undefined in the inner function, whereas the reference to the local variable `self` remains in scope and is accessible there.

## 4. What is the significance of, and reason for, wrapping the entire content of a JavaScript source file in a function block?

IFFY => Immediately-invoked function expression.

This is an increasingly common practice, employed by many popular JavaScript libraries (jQuery, Node.js, etc.). This technique creates a closure around the entire contents of the file which, perhaps most importantly, creates a private namespace and thereby helps avoid potential name clashes between different JavaScript modules and libraries.

Another feature of this technique is to allow for an easily referenceable (presumably shorter) alias for a global variable. This is often used, for example, in jQuery plugins. jQuery allows you to disable the $ reference to the jQuery namespace, using jQuery.noConflict(). If this has been done, your code can still use $ employing this closure technique, as follows:

```javascript
(function($) { /* jQuery plugin code referencing $ */ } )(jQuery);
```

## 5. What is the significance, and what are the benefits, of including 'use strict' at the beginning of a JavaScript source file?

The short and most important answer here is that `use strict` is a way to voluntarily enforce stricter parsing and error handling on your JavaScript code at runtime. Code errors that would otherwise have been ignored or would have failed silently will now generate errors or throw exceptions. In general, it is a good practice.

Some of the key benefits of strict mode include:

* Makes debugging easier. Code errors that would otherwise have been ignored or would have failed silently will now generate errors or throw exceptions, alerting you sooner to problems in your code and directing you more quickly to their source.

* Prevents accidental globals. Without strict mode, assigning a value to an undeclared variable automatically creates a global variable with that name. This is one of the most common errors in JavaScript. In strict mode, attempting to do so throws an error.

* Eliminates `this` coercion. Without strict mode, a reference to a `this` value of null or undefined is automatically coerced to the global. This can cause many headfakes and pull-out-your-hair kind of bugs. In strict mode, referencing a a this value of null or undefined throws an error.

* Disallows duplicate parameter values. Strict mode throws an error when it detects a duplicate named argument for a function (e.g., `function foo(val1, val2, val1){})` thereby catching what is almost certainly a bug in your code that you might otherwise have wasted lots of time tracking down.
  * Note: It used to be (in ECMAScript 5) that strict mode would disallow duplicate property names (e.g. `var object = {foo: "bar", foo: "baz"};`) but as of ECMAScript 2015 this is no longer the case.

* Makes eval() safer. There are some differences in the way `eval()` behaves in strict mode and in non-strict mode. Most significantly, in strict mode, variables and functions declared inside of an `eval()` statement are not created in the containing scope (they are created in the containing scope in non-strict mode, which can also be a common source of problems).

* Throws error on invalid usage of `delete`. The `delete` operator (used to remove properties from objects) cannot be used on non-configurable properties of the object. Non-strict code will fail silently when an attempt is made to delete a non-configurable property, whereas strict mode will throw an error in such a case.

## 6. Consider the two functions below. Will they both return the same thing? Why or why not?

```javascript
function foo1()
{
  return {
      bar: "hello"
  };
}

function foo2()
{
  return
  {
      bar: "hello"
  };
}
```

Surprisingly, these two functions will not return the same thing. Rather:

```javascript
console.log("foo1 returns:");
console.log(foo1());
console.log("foo2 returns:");
console.log(foo2());
will yield:
```
```javascript
foo1 returns:
Object {bar: "hello"}
foo2 returns:
undefined 
```

Not only is this surprising, but what makes this particularly gnarly is that `foo2()` returns undefined without any error being thrown.

The reason for this has to do with the fact that semicolons are technically optional in JavaScript (although omitting them is generally really bad form). As a result, when the line containing the `return` statement (with nothing else on the line) is encountered in `foo2()`, a semicolon is automatically inserted immediately after the return statement.

No error is thrown since the remainder of the code is perfectly valid, even though it doesn’t ever get invoked or do anything (it is simply an unused code block that defines a property `bar` which is equal to the string `"hello"`).

This behavior also argues for following the convention of placing an opening curly brace at the end of a line in JavaScript, rather than on the beginning of a new line. As shown here, this becomes more than just a stylistic preference in JavaScript.

## 7. What will the code below output? Explain your answer.

```javascript
console.log(0.1 + 0.2);
console.log(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3);
```

An educated answer to this question would simply be: “You can’t be sure. it might print out 0.3 and true, or it might not. Numbers in JavaScript are all treated with floating point precision, and as such, may not always yield the expected results.”

The example provided above is classic case that demonstrates this issue. Surprisingly, it will print out:
```
0.30000000000000004
false
```
A typical solution is to compare the absolute difference between two numbers with the special constant Number.EPSILON:
```
function areTheNumbersAlmostEqual(num1, num2) {
	return Math.abs( num1 - num2 ) < Number.EPSILON;
}

console.log(areTheNumbersAlmostEqual(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3));
```

## 8. What is `NaN`? What is its type? How can you reliably test if a value is equal to NaN?

The `NaN` property represents a value that is “not a number”. This special value results from an operation that could not be performed either because one of the operands was non-numeric (e.g., `"abc" / 4`), or because the result of the operation is non-numeric.

While this seems straightforward enough, there are a couple of somewhat surprising characteristics of `NaN` that can result in hair-pulling bugs if one is not aware of them.

For one thing, although `NaN` means “not a number”, its type is, believe it or not, `Number`:

```javascript
console.log(typeof NaN === "number");  // logs "true"
```
Additionally, NaN compared to anything – even itself! – is false:

```javascript
console.log(NaN === NaN);  // logs "false"
```

A semi-reliable way to test whether a number is equal to `NaN` is with the built-in function `isNaN()`, but even using `isNaN()` is an imperfect solution.

A better solution would either be to use `value !== value`, which would only produce true if the value is equal to `NaN`. Also, ES6 offers a new `Number.isNaN()` function, which is a different and more reliable than the old global `isNaN()` function.

## 9. Discuss possible ways to write a function isInteger(x) that determines if x is an integer.

This may sound trivial and, in fact, it is trivial with ECMAscript 6 which introduces a new `Number.isInteger()` function for precisely this purpose. However, prior to ECMAScript 6, this is a bit more complicated, since no equivalent of the `Number.isInteger()` method is provided.

The issue is that, in the ECMAScript specification, integers only exist conceptually; i.e., numeric values are __always__ stored as floating point values.

With that in mind, the simplest and cleanest pre-ECMAScript-6 solution (which is also sufficiently robust to return false even if a non-numeric value such as a string or null is passed to the function) would 
be the following use of the bitwise XOR operator:

```javascript
function isInteger(x) { return (x ^ 0) === x; } 
```

The following solution would also work, although not as elegant as the one above:

```javascript
function isInteger(x) { return Math.round(x) === x; }
```

Note that `Math.ceil()` or `Math.floor()` could be used equally well (instead of `Math.round()`) in the above implementation.

Or alternatively:

```javascript
function isInteger(x) { return (typeof x === 'number') && (x % 1 === 0); }
```

One fairly common incorrect solution is the following:

```javascript
function isInteger(x) { return parseInt(x, 10) === x; }
```

While this `parseInt`-based approach will work well for many values of x, once x becomes quite large, it will fail to work properly. The problem is that parseInt() coerces its first parameter to a string before parsing digits. Therefore, once the number becomes sufficiently large, its string representation will be presented in exponential form (e.g., `1e+21`). Accordingly, `parseInt()` will then try to parse `1e+21`, but will stop parsing when it reaches the e character and will therefore return a value of 1. Observe:

```javascript
> String(1000000000000000000000)
'1e+21'
> parseInt(1000000000000000000000, 10)
1
> parseInt(1000000000000000000000, 10) === 1000000000000000000000
false
```

## 10. In what order will the numbers 1-4 be logged to the console when the code below is executed? Why?
```javascript
(function() {
    console.log(1); 
    setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000); 
    setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0); 
    console.log(4);
})();
```

The values will be logged in the following order:
```
1
4
3
2
```
Let’s first explain the parts of this that are presumably more obvious:

* 1 and 4 are displayed first since they are logged by simple calls to console.log() without any delay
* 2 is displayed after 3 because 2 is being logged after a delay of 1000 msecs (i.e., 1 second) whereas 3 is being logged after a delay of 0 msecs.

OK, fine. But if 3 is being logged after a delay of 0 msecs, doesn’t that mean that it is being logged right away? And, if so, shouldn’t it be logged before 4, since 4 is being logged by a later line of code?

The answer has to do with properly understanding JavaScript events and timing.

The browser has an event loop which checks the event queue and processes pending events. For example, if an event happens in the background (e.g., a script onload event) while the browser is busy (e.g., processing an onclick), the event gets appended to the queue. When the onclick handler is complete, the queue is checked and the event is then handled (e.g., the onload script is executed).

Similarly, `setTimeout()` also puts execution of its referenced function into the event queue if the browser is busy.

When a value of zero is passed as the second argument to `setTimeout()`, it attempts to execute the specified function “as soon as possible”. Specifically, execution of the function is placed on the event queue to occur on the next timer tick. Note, though, that this is not immediate; the function is not executed until the next tick. That’s why in the above example, the call to console.log(4) occurs before the call to console.log(3) (since the call to console.log(3) is invoked via setTimeout, so it is slightly delayed).

## 11. Consider the following code snippet:

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  var btn = document.createElement('button');
  btn.appendChild(document.createTextNode('Button ' + i));
  btn.addEventListener('click', function(){ console.log(i); });
  document.body.appendChild(btn);
}
```

(a) What gets logged to the console when the user clicks on “Button 4” and why?

(b) Provide one or more alternate implementations that will work as expected.

Answers:

(a) No matter what button the user clicks the number 5 will always be logged to the console. This is because, at the point that the onclick method is invoked (for any of the buttons), the for loop has already completed and the variable i already has a value of 5. (Bonus points for the interviewee if they know enough to talk about how execution contexts, variable objects, activation objects, and the internal “scope” property contribute to the closure behavior.)

(b) The key to making this work is to capture the value of i at each pass through the for loop by passing it into a newly created function object. Here are four possible ways to accomplish this:

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  var btn = document.createElement('button');
  btn.appendChild(document.createTextNode('Button ' + i));
  btn.addEventListener('click', (function(i) {
    return function() { console.log(i); };
  })(i));
  document.body.appendChild(btn);
}
```

Alternatively, you could wrap the entire call to btn.addEventListener in the new anonymous function:

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  var btn = document.createElement('button');
  btn.appendChild(document.createTextNode('Button ' + i));
  (function (i) {
    btn.addEventListener('click', function() { console.log(i); });
  })(i);
  document.body.appendChild(btn);
}
```

Or, we could replace the for loop with a call to the array object’s native forEach method:

```javascript
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'].forEach(function (value, i) {
  var btn = document.createElement('button');
  btn.appendChild(document.createTextNode('Button ' + i));
  btn.addEventListener('click', function() { console.log(i); });
  document.body.appendChild(btn);
});
```

Lastly, the simplest solution, if you’re in an ES6/ES2015 context, is to use let i instead of var i:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  var btn = document.createElement('button');
  btn.appendChild(document.createTextNode('Button ' + i));
  btn.addEventListener('click', function(){ console.log(i); });
  document.body.appendChild(btn);
}
```

# Algorithms Part

## 1. Write a simple function (less than 160 characters) that returns a boolean indicating whether or not a string is a palindrome.

```javascript
function isPalindrome(str) {
  str = str.replace(/\W/g, '').toLowerCase();
  return (str == str.split('').reverse().join(''));
}
```

For example:

```javascript
console.log(isPalindrome("level"));                   // logs 'true'
console.log(isPalindrome("levels"));                  // logs 'false'
console.log(isPalindrome("A car, a man, a maraca"));  // logs 'true'
```
