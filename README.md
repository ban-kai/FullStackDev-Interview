# Java Interview Questions Compilation

## 1. Explain JVM, JRE and JDK?

__JVM (Java Virtual Machine)__: It is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides run-time environment in which java bytecode can be executed. It follows three notations:

* Specification: It is a document that describes the implementation of the Java virtual machine. It is provided by Sun and other companies.
* Implementation: It is a program that meets the requirements of JVM specification.
* Runtime Instance: An instance of JVM is created whenever you write a java command on the command prompt and run the class.

__JRE (Java Runtime Environment)__ : JRE refers to a runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed. It implements the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and provides all the class libraries and other support files that JVM uses at runtime. So JRE is a software package that contains what is required to run a Java program. Basically, itâ€™s an implementation of the JVM which physically exists. 

__JDK(Java Development Kit)__ : It is the tool necessary to compile, document and package Java programs. The JDK completely includes JRE which contains tools for Java programmers. The Java Development Kit is provided free of charge. Along with JRE, it includes an interpreter/loader, a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development. In short, it contains JRE + development tools.

## 2. Is Java a Compiled or an Interpreted programming language ?

Java implementations typically use a two-step compilation process. Java source code is compiled down to bytecode by the Java compiler. The bytecode is executed by a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Modern JVMs use a technique called Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation to compile the bytecode to native instructions understood by hardware CPU on the fly at runtime.

Some implementations of JVM may choose to interpret the bytecode instead of JIT compiling it to machine code, and running it directly. While this is still considered an "interpreter," It's quite different from interpreters that read and execute the high level source code (i.e. in this case, Java source code is not interpreted directly, the bytecode, output of Java compiler, is.)

It is technically possible to compile Java down to native code ahead-of-time and run the resulting binary. It is also possible to interpret the Java code directly.

To summarize, depending on the execution environment, bytecode can be:

* compiled ahead of time and executed as native code (similar to most C++ compilers)
* compiled just-in-time and executed
* interpreted
* directly executed by a supported processor (bytecode is the native instruction set of some CPUs)
